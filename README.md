## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round, the temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu will be displayed. 

## Results

### Three major points

- One major point that can be derived from the two analysis deliverables is that there are more data temperatures from the month of June than there are in December. June has a total of 1700 dates and December has a total of 1517 days as shown below in the images.

- Although there are 183 more days recorded in June, the numbers show that even though June and December are polar opposites when considering the season, they still have similar average temperatures. The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit and 71.04 in December. December is only slightly cooler.

- The summary statistics for the temperature dataframes of June and December also show that they share similar max temperatures that are only different by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. June has a max temperature of 85 and December has a max temperature of 83.

## Summary

The results from both months of June and December prove to show that the temperature trends are favorable for an ice cream and surf show to be sustainable year round as there are fairly comfortable temperatures throughout the year. I feel that these temperatures will be tolerable for tourists and locals who would want to surf and eat ice cream especially if certain tourists are already accustomed to colder temps in their region. 

Other additional queries that will also be a factor will be the precipiation totals during the months of June and December specifically. These can also provide more insight into the decision to fund the shop. The numbers in the queries are for the days that experienced precipitation in the two months.
